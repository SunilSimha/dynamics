# dynamics
This is a module developed for the course on Dynamical Astrophysics at UCSC (Fall 2018).
It is mainly having assignment related functions and is liable to change often. Full documentation
might come later.

Assignment solutions are in docs. Installing this module is simple:
* Clone this repo
* Enter the cloned directory
* run `python setup.py develop`. I wouldn't recommend using the `install` option as of yet.

We needed to use REBOUND (https://github.com/hannorein/rebound) for some questions, so
I'd call that a dependancy in addition to numpy, scipy, astropy and matplotlib. 

Disclaimer: I'm just a student working on some assignments. This code most likely isn't
all that optimal. Please use at your own risk.
